This is the project for Counter-Strike Deathmatch 1.5.
Counter-Strike Deathmatch has been a very nice mod ever since,
but the newer versions don't support CS 1.5 anymore. So I (sake)
decided to create a new CSDM plugin for AMXModX 
(compatible from 1.76 to newest versions). A first demo Server
can be found at (csdmsake.dyndns.org:27015).

Take care and Happy fragging!

P.S.: Everybody willing to help is welcome!
